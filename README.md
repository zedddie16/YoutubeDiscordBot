# YoutubeDiscordBot
My little project for learning **Rust** lang.
*YoutubeDiscordBot* is bot for ***discord*** on Rust that takes last uploaded ***youtube*** video of selected channel and pushes a message in selected discord channel when new video appears.

### There is some bindings

(in discord channel with bot included)

>/set clips - sets actual channel to be **clip** channel

>/!bot - does check last video of selected channel and sends it as a reply in a same discord channel

I started this project a little time ago and i have a lot of features to add in my mind. I'll try to implement it and make my project look good.
